In this project, we will use a deep learning model called AlexNet to sort images of flowers. This model is a convolutional neural network that is known for its high accuracy in image recognition tasks.

The dataset used for this project will consist of images of flowers that have been categorized into different classes based on their species. The goal is to train the model to accurately classify the flowers based on their species, which will help in the sorting process.

Economic Importance for Florida Bee Farmers
Florida is home to a variety of wildflowers that are important for honey bee foraging. Honey bees are essential for the pollination of many crops, and the honey industry is a significant part of Florida's agriculture industry.

Sorting flowers manually can be a time-consuming and expensive process, and there is a risk of human error. Using a computer vision system such as the one we are developing can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the sorting process, which can lead to cost savings for farmers and increased productivity for the honey bee industry as a whole.

By accurately identifying the species of flowers, farmers can strategically plant different types of flowers in their fields, which can provide honey bees with a more diverse range of nectar and pollen sources. This can lead to healthier and more productive bee colonies, which can ultimately lead to increased honey production.

Additionally, accurately identifying the species of flowers can also help farmers monitor the health and productivity of their bee colonies. If certain species of flowers are not being visited by bees, this may indicate a problem with the bee colony that needs to be addressed.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has significant economic importance for Florida bee farmers. By using a deep learning model like AlexNet to accurately sort flowers based on their species, farmers can save time and money, increase productivity, and ultimately increase honey production.
