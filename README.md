# Sorting Fruits using AlexNet
In this project, we will use a deep learning model called AlexNet to sort images of fruits, particularly oranges. This model is a convolutional neural network that is known for its high accuracy in image recognition tasks.

The dataset used for this project will consist of images of oranges that have been categorized into different classes based on their quality. The goal is to train the model to accurately classify the oranges based on their quality, which will help in the sorting process.

### Economic Importance for Florida Orange Farmers
Florida is one of the largest producers of oranges in the world, and the orange industry is a significant part of the state's economy. The quality of oranges is an essential factor in determining their market value, and sorting oranges based on their quality is a crucial step in the supply chain.

Sorting oranges manually can be a time-consuming and expensive process, and there is a risk of human error. Using a computer vision system such as the one we are developing can greatly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the sorting process, which can lead to cost savings for farmers and increased profitability for the industry as a whole.

Additionally, accurately sorting oranges based on their quality can help ensure that only the highest quality oranges are sent to market, which can improve the reputation of Florida oranges and lead to increased demand and higher prices.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has significant economic importance for Florida orange farmers. By using a deep learning model like AlexNet to accurately sort oranges based on their quality, farmers can save time and money, increase profitability, and improve the reputation and demand for Florida oranges.
